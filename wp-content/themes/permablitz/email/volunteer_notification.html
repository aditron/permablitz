<br><br>
Thanks for signing up to the blitz! The host has now been notified of your interest, and will get back to you over the next week. Don't freak out if you don't hear anything for a few days, sometimes hosts prefer to email everyone when the blitz is full, so keep an eye on the event - you'll definitely hear from the host once the "Booked out" sign goes up!
<br><br>
Thanks again for putting your hand up - it's people like you that make Permablitz what it is!
<br><br>
<strong>If you find yourself unable to attend for whatever reason, please let us know by filling in the form here: <a href="http://www.permablitz.net/volunteers/[key]/" style="color: #000;">http://www.permablitz.net/volunteers/[key]/</a></strong>

Cheers,<br>
The team at Permablitz decentral</td></tr></table>
